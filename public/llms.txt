# Waveform Assessment

> An AI-marked drawing-based assessment tool for A-Level Music Technology waveform identification.

Built by Mike Lehnert. Deployed at https://waveform-assessment.vercel.app

## What This App Does

Students listen to audio waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle) and draw the correct waveform shape on a canvas. Submissions are then marked automatically using the Claude Vision API, which compares the student's drawing against the mathematically correct waveform.

### For Students
- Listen to a generated waveform
- Draw the waveform shape on an interactive canvas
- Receive AI-generated feedback on accuracy
- See a side-by-side comparison of their drawing vs. the correct answer

### For the Teacher
- View all student submissions in a dashboard
- See AI-generated marks with colour-coded badges
- Review detailed feedback including strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions
- Compare student drawings against correct answers in a modal view

## Marking Criteria

- **Cycle Count** (4 marks) — Did the student draw the correct number of cycles?
- **Shape Accuracy** (4 marks) — Does the drawn shape match the waveform type?
- **Drawing Quality** (2 marks) — Smoothness, proportion, and clarity
- **Total:** 10 marks per submission

## How It Works Technically

1. The app generates a mathematically correct waveform (configurable type and cycle count)
2. The student draws their interpretation on an HTML canvas
3. Both images (student drawing + correct answer) are sent to the Claude Vision API
4. Claude analyses the comparison and returns structured marks and feedback
5. Results are stored in Supabase for teacher review

## Curriculum Context

This assessment targets waveform identification skills within the Pearson Edexcel A-Level Music Technology specification (Component 4). Students need to recognise and reproduce standard waveform shapes as part of their understanding of synthesis and sound design.

## Not Intended For

- General-purpose drawing or art assessment
- Music production workflows
- Public use outside the specific classroom context
